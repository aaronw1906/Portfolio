            There is no other earth. Earth, our home planet, is unlike any other planet, is the only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. The civilization of mankind possibly causing irreversible alterations to earth’s geological, biological and ecological system. Around the world, people are experiencing both subtle and stark effects of climate change. Some gradually shifting weather patterns, rising sea levels and more extreme weather events such as heat waves or cyclones are all clear and devastating evidence of a rapidly changing climate. Human impacts can be both negative and positive, for instance climate change in Siberia, are expected to improve food production and local economic activity, as least in a short to medium terms, whereas, Bangladesh has experienced an increase in climate -sensitive diseases such as malaria, dengue, childhood diarrhea’s, and pneumonia among vulnerable communities.

          <blockquote>"Climate change can no longer be denied. It can't be edited out. It can't be omitted from the conversation that the planet will continue to cook."</blockquote>

          <p>
            First, climate change poses a wide range of risk to population health for example heat waves, amplified air pollution, decrease in crop yield and marine productivity, and worst, impoverishment or resources conflict. A warmer climate leads to higher levels of air pollution. It increases the rates and ranges of transmission of infectious disease through unclean water and contaminated food, and by affecting vector organisms, such as mosquitoes, and reservoir host species that harbor the infectious agent such as cattle, bats and rodents. Therefore, global warming together with changes in food and water supplies, can indirectly cause an increase in range of adverse health outcomes, including malnutrition, diarrhea, injuries, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, water-borne and insect-transmitted diseases.

            In addition to changing weather, agriculture, animal production, climate change will affect natural landscapes and what world heritage site you are still able to see, what wine you will be able to drink, what trees you’ll be able to plant in your yard. This climate change causes small changes in temperature in years’ time, but there will be more heat waves and other extreme weather events, more dramatic shifts from periods of rain to periods of drought, and other changes that go beyond mere temperatures. These changes will vary from city to city. You might think it’s not something we can picture it of, as this is a very drastically severe condition, but we surely can imagine what we need to change in order to adapt to the current climate situation, example changing in what we indulge and enjoy.

          <p>
            The effects of climate change are significant in today’s society and will have a tremendous impact on human life across everyone in all communities. In the future, wars over natural resources could result in millions or even billions of casualties. Climate change is humanity’s most significant challenge, and we cannot afford to ignore it any longer. It’s time for a decisive action to try to save our one and only planet, Earth.
